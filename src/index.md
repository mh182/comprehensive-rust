# Welcome to Comprehensive Rust ðŸ¦€

This Rust course covers the full spectrum of Rust, from basic syntax to advanced topics like generics and error handling.

The goal of the course is to teach you Rust. We assume you don't know anything
about Rust and hope to:

- Give you a comprehensive understanding of the Rust syntax and language.
- Enable you to modify existing programs and write new programs in Rust.
- Show you common Rust idioms.

We call the first three course days Rust Fundamentals.

Building on this, we will dive into a whole day on concurrency in Rust.
We cover both classical concurrency (preemptively scheduling using threads and
mutexes) and async/await concurrency (cooperative multitasking using
futures).

On the last day, we will learn how to use Rust to run a [web server](https://mo8it.com/blog/getting-started-with-rust-backends/).
You will also vote for a topic on the first day to be covered in the last day.
Possible topics are:

- Graphical user interfaces (GUI) using [`egui`](https://www.egui.rs/)
- Command line interfaces (CLI) using [`clap`](https://docs.rs/clap/latest/clap/)
- Terminal user interafaces (TUI) using [`ratatui`](https://github.com/ratatui-org/ratatui)
- Your suggestion!

## Disclaimer

Rust is a large language and we won't be able to cover all of it in a few days.

You will not be a Rust expert at the end of the course, but you will be familiar with Rust's basics.

Attending this course is not an alternative to reading [the official Rust book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/book/).
You should read the book if you seek a deeper understanding of Rust after this course.

## Assumptions

The course assumes that you already know how to program. Rust is a statically-typed
language and we will sometimes make comparisons with C and C++ to better
explain or contrast the Rust approach.

If you know how to program in a dynamically-typed language such as Python or
JavaScript, then you will be able to follow along just fine too.
