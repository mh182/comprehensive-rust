# Code Samples in This Training

For this training, we will mostly explore the Rust language through examples
which can be executed through your browser. This makes the setup much easier and
ensures a consistent experience for everyone.

The code blocks in this course are fully interactive:

```rust,editable
fn main() {
    println!("Edit me!");
}
```

You can use <kbd>Ctrl + Enter</kbd> to execute the code when focus is in the
text box.

Most code samples are editable like shown above. A few code samples
are not editable for various reasons:

- The embedded playgrounds cannot execute unit tests. Copy-paste the
  code and open it in the real Playground to demonstrate unit tests.

- The embedded playgrounds lose their state the moment you navigate
  away from the page!
