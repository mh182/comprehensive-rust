# Web Server

Now that you know the basics of Rust, you are able to learn about any specific topic/crate in Rust.

As an example of a topic that builds on the basics we have learned, we will build a basic web server (backend) in Rust using the [Axum](https://docs.rs/axum/latest/axum/) framework.

We will follow the tutorial in [this blog post](https://mo8it.com/blog/getting-started-with-rust-backends/).
