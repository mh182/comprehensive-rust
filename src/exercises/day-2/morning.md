# Day 2: Morning Exercises

> **⚠️ Before starting with the exercises: Run the command `git pull` in the directory `collective-rustlings` to get the updated tasks for this day!**

**In case you didn't finish the exercises from yesterday**, you will not be able to do today's exercises with `rustlings watch`.
In that case, you have to use the command `rustlings run EXERCISE_NAME` where the exercise name is one of those listed below.
To get a hint for that exercise, you can run the command `rustlings hint EXERCISE_NAME`.

You should do the following Rustlings exercises:

- `structs1`
- `structs2`
- `structs3`
- `enums1`
- `enums2`
- `enums3`

---

**Only if you have time left**, you can try working on the following two exercises about implementing methods in two contexts:

- [Simple struct which tracks health statistics](health-statistics.md)
- [Multiple structs and enums for a drawing library](points-polygons.md)
