# Day 1: Morning Exercises

We will be using [`rustlings`](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustlings) for the exercises in this course.
`rustlings` is a collection of "small exercises to get you used to reading and writing Rust code" and an awesome learning resource for Rust!

Before starting with the exercises, you have to follow the following steps:

- [Install Rust using `rustup`](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)
- [Install VS-Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) (unless you want to use your own editor with support for the language server [`rust-analyzer`](https://rust-analyzer.github.io/))
  - [Install the `rust-analyzer` plugin](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=rust-lang.rust-analyzer)
- Install Git if not already installed on your system.
- [Follow the instructions in the README](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustlings#windows) to clone the `rustlings` repository, install the program, register yourself and enable the `rust-analyzer` support.
- Open the directory `rustlings` of the cloned repository in VS-Code.
- Open a terminal in VS-Code and run the command `rustlings watch` in it.

You should do the following Rustlings exercises:

- `intro1`
- `intro2`
- `variables1`
- `variables2`
- `variables3`
- `variables4`
- `primitive_types1`
- `primitive_types2`
- `primitive_types3`
- `primitive_types4`
- `primitive_types5`
- `primitive_types6`
- `if1`
- `if2`
- `if3`

`rustlings watch` will guide you through these exercises in the same order.
But you should stop after the last exercise listed above.
The rest of the exercises will be done later.
